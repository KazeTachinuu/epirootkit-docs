## TODO: Implement Command Execution Features

- [x] Parse and validate incoming command messages
- [ ] Execute commands securely in kernel/user space
- [x] Capture and return stdout, stderr, and exit code
- [ ] Handle command errors and edge cases
- [ ] Test command execution end-to-end

_This section will be updated with documentation once features are implemented and tested._
