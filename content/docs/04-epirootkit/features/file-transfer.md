# 1. Remote Command Execution

**What we did**  
Allow arbitrary program execution via C2.

**How it works**  
- Receive a packet:  
  ```
  EXEC <len>\n<payload>
  ```
- Use `call_usermodehelper(argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_PROC)` to spawn the process.
- Capture its `stdout`/`stderr` via kernel pipes and send back encrypted.

# 2. File Upload

**What we did**  
Accept files from the attacker.

**How it works**  
- Receive `UPLOAD <path> <len>\n<data>`.
- `filp_open("/usr/share/epirootkit/<path>", O_CREAT|O_WRONLY, 0600)`.
- `kernel_write()` the data.
- Our `getdents()` hook keeps `/usr/share/epirootkit` hidden.

# 3. File Download

**What we did**  
Send files to the attacker.

**How it works**  
- Receive `DOWNLOAD <path>`.
- `filp_open()` + `kernel_read()` in chunks.
- Stream each chunk over the encrypted C2 link.
