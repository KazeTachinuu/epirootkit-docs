Once authenticated, the EpiRootkit can receive commands from the C2 server, execute them on the victim machine, and return the results.

## Receiving Commands

1.  **Command Message (`COMMAND`)**:
    *   The C2 server sends commands to an authenticated EpiRootkit client using a `COMMAND` message.
    *   **Format**: A JSON object, encrypted using AES-256-GCM.
        ```json
        {
          "type": "COMMAND",
          "id": "unique_command_id_string", // e.g., a timestamp
          "data": "command_string_to_execute" // e.g., "ls -la /tmp" or "whoami"
        }
        ```
    *   The `id` is a unique identifier generated by the C2 server for tracking the command.
    *   The `data` field contains the raw command string that the EpiRootkit should execute.

## Executing Commands

*   The EpiRootkit is responsible for parsing the `data` field and executing the command on the victim system.
*   It needs to capture:
    *   Standard Output (stdout) of the command.
    *   Standard Error (stderr) of the command.
    *   The exit status (or exit code) of the command.

## Returning Results

1.  **Command Result Message (`COMMAND_RESULT`)**:
    *   After executing the command, the EpiRootkit must send the results back to the C2 server using a `COMMAND_RESULT` message.
    *   **Format**: A JSON object, encrypted using AES-256-GCM.
        ```json
        {
          "type": "COMMAND_RESULT",
          "commandId": "unique_command_id_string", // Must match the id from the received COMMAND message
          "status": "success" or "error", // Indicates overall success or failure of execution
          "output": "combined_stdout_and_stderr_or_error_message",
          // Optional: separate stdout/stderr if desired, but C2 currently expects a single 'output' field.
          // "stdout": "standard_output_string", 
          // "stderr": "standard_error_string",
          "exitCode": 0 // The integer exit code of the command
        }
        ```
    *   `commandId`: **Crucially**, this must be the same `id` that was received in the original `COMMAND` message from the C2 server. This allows the C2 to correlate results with sent commands.
    *   `status`: A string indicating if the command execution was generally successful or encountered an error (e.g., command not found).
    *   `output`: A string containing the output from the command. As per `subject.md` requirements, this should include both stdout and stderr. The C2 server currently processes this as a single string but can be adapted if the rootkit sends separate stdout/stderr fields.
    *   `exitCode`: The numerical exit status of the executed command.

2.  **C2 Server Processing**:
    *   The C2 server receives the `COMMAND_RESULT` message.
    *   It decrypts and parses the message.
    *   It emits a `command:result_received` event, which is logged to the C2 CLI, displaying the `commandId`, `status`, and `output` associated with the client's alias.

Properly formatting and returning the `COMMAND_RESULT` is essential for the operator to see the outcome of their remotely executed commands.
