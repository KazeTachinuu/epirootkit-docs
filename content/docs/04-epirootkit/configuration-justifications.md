{{< alert context="info" icon="⚙️" text="This page explains why we chose Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with the 5.4.x kernel for our rootkit development and testing." />}}

## Environment

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)  
- **Kernel**: 5.4.x (LTS)

---

## Why Ubuntu 20.04 LTS?

{{< alert context="success" icon="check" text="Perfect balance between realism and convinience." />}}

- Widely deployed on servers and desktops  
- Official cloud and container images simplify automation  
- Already uses interesting kernel version (5.4.x) so no need to compile.

## Why Kernel 5.4.x?

{{< alert context="primary" icon="🔧" text="Balances modern hooking APIs with exported symbols and no mandatory module signing." />}}

1. **Full ftrace support**  
   - Kernel 4.1+ stabilized the ftrace API (`ftrace_set_filter_ip()`, `register_ftrace_function()`).  
   - 5.4.x includes every hook we need.  

2. **Exported `kallsyms_lookup_name()`**  
   - Up through 5.6 the symbol remains exported.
   - Allows us to resolve `sys_call_table` at runtime--no kernel recompilation.  

3. **Unsigned module loading**  
   - Kernels ≥ 5.7 often enforce module signatures or Secure Boot lockdown.  
   - Ubuntu 20.04’s 5.4.x ships without these restrictions by default.

4. **Already compiled in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** 
   - As mentionned before Ubuntu 20.04 LTS comes already packing with kernel version 5.4.x making it very easy for us to use and deploy.

---

## Alternative Options

- **Kernel 5.6**  
  - Technically we could go until kernel version 5.6 but for practical reasons mentionned above, we went with 5.4.x. Wich in my opinion is still relevant because in LTS. 
- **Debian 11 (5.10.x)**  
  - Still exports our symbols--requires disabling module signature checks.
