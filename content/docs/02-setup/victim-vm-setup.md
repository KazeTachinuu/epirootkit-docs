Follow these steps once the host environment is ready and the VMs have been created or downloaded.


1. Place the `victim.qcow2` disk in the `vm/` directory at the project root (verify via `./scripts/check_vms.sh` or see [VM Installation & Verification]({{< relref "vm-installation.md" >}})).

2. Launch the victim VM with:
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/run_vms.sh victim
   ```
   Or both VMs with:
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/run_vms.sh
   ```

3. On the victim VM:
   - The VM has auto-login enabled for the `victim` user (no password prompt).  
   - Its static IP is **192.168.200.10**.
   - The password is `jules`.



4. When finished, close the QEMU window or use **Ctrl+C** on the host script to shut down both VMs.
