The Web UI is a modern frontend for the EpiRootkit Attacking Program (C2 Server). It provides a graphical, tiling window manager interface for managing clients, sending commands, and monitoring events.

**Philosophy:**
- Usability and productivity for operators
- Real-time feedback and event visibility
- Extensible, modular panel system
- Keyboard-driven workflow (with mouse support)

**Main Features:**
- Tiling window manager UI for flexible panel arrangement
- Real-time event log panel
- Terminal, Overview, and Upload/Download panels
- Global keyboard shortcuts for all major actions
- Drag-and-drop panel reordering

This section covers the rationale, features, and usage of the Web UI. See the following pages for details on setup, features, and development notes.
