## i3 like interface

Yes, you read that right. I really tried to make this part of the Web UI feel like i3-wm.

{{< figure src="/images/webui/i3.png" alt="i3 like interface" class="img-fluid" >}}

Basically it's a tiling window manager that allows you to move panels around with the keyboard.

## Why ?

Because I bloody can, that's why.


{{< alert context="info" text="I had to use `Alt` as Modifier, I'm truly saddened by this but Ubuntu wouldn't let me use the `Windows` key in firefox..." />}}

You can use this as like a dashboard widgets where you can move the panels around resize them etc to neatly manage your precious display real estate.

## Shortcuts

{{< table >}}
| Shortcut | Action |

| `Alt + ←` or `Alt + H` | Move panel to the left |
| `Alt + →` or `Alt + L` | Move panel to the right |
| `Alt + ↑` or `Alt + K` | Move panel up |
| `Alt + ↓` or `Alt + J` | Move panel down |
| `Alt + Q` | Close current panel |
| `Alt + Enter` | Open and focus on client Terminal |
| `Alt + E` | Open and focus on Event Logs |
| `Alt + O` | Open and focus on Overview |
| `Alt + U` | Open and focus on Upload/Download |
| `←, →, ↑, ↓` | Focus on previous/next/up/down panel |

## But for real, why ?

To be honest, at first I just wanted a nice way to display the panels and move them around like widgets.

But then, as I was implementing the idea I had in mind, I realized it was basically slowly making a worse version of i3-wm. 

So I just went all in because why not ?
